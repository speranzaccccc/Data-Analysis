# 📊 User Behavior Analysis and Path Mining Project

## 📝 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing user behavior data to gain actionable business insights, improve customer segmentation, predict user churn, and recommend personalized products. By leveraging various data mining techniques, the project aims to enhance user engagement, increase conversion rates, and optimize marketing strategies.

## 🎯 **Objectives**
- Develop comprehensive **user profiles** using demographic and behavioral data.
- Perform **user segmentation** via clustering to identify key customer groups.
- Predict **user churn** to proactively retain valuable customers.
- Design an **item recommendation system** tailored to user preferences.
- Visualize **user behavior paths** to identify key drop-off points in the user journey.

## 📊 **Key Steps & Methodology**

### 🚀 **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyze demographic distributions (age, gender, income, location)
- Explore behavioral metrics (login frequency, pages viewed, time spent)
- Visualize purchase frequency and total spending trends

### 🧹 **2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
- Handle missing values and outliers  
- Encode categorical variables (gender, location, interests)  
- Normalize numerical features (income, spending, order value)  
- Create derived features (user activity score, spending ratio)  

### 🧭 **3. User Segmentation (Clustering)**
- Apply **K-Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering** techniques  
- Visualize clusters and interpret user segments  
- Develop **user personas** for marketing targeting  

### 🔍 **4. Churn Prediction**
- Define churn criteria and label dataset  
- Train models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and evaluate with precision/recall  
- Analyze feature importance using SHAP values  

### 📦 **5. Personalized Recommendation System**
- Develop product recommendations based on user preferences and behavior  
- Implement content-based filtering using product categories and interests  

### 📢 **6. Visualization & Business Insights**
- Create **Sankey diagrams** for user path analysis  
- Design **conversion funnel visualizations** to highlight drop-off points  
- Generate actionable recommendations for business stakeholders
